Hand gesture is classified as an intuitive method for human to interact with the computer. It is useful for elderly people who cannot express their feelings by words. This paper proposed the hand gesture recognition technique for the elderly by using contour detection with convex hull feature extraction and rule-based classification. Vision-based hand gesture recognition is considered in classifying six hand gestures as lingual description. From the experimental results, the hand gesture system provides good detection and classification results for all the six static hand gestures.\",\n          \"\\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The undrained bearing capacity of shallow circular piles in non-homogeneous and anisotropic clay is investigated by the lower bound (LB) finite element limit analysis (FELA) under two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric condition using second-order cone programming, and the new solution of the problem is presented. Modified from the isotropic von Mises yield criterion, a cross-anisotropic undrained strength criterion of clays under the axisymmetric state of stress requiring three input shear strengths in triaxial compression, direct simple shear, and triaxial extension is employed in the 2D axisymmetric LB FELA. Parametric studies on the effects of pile embedment ratio, dimensionless strength gradient, anisotropic strength ratio, and pile roughness are investigated extensively, while the predicted failure mechanisms associated with these parameters are discussed and compared. Numerical results of undrained end bearing capacity of shallow circular piles are summarized in the form of design tables that are useful for design practice and represent a new contribution to the field of pile capacity considering the combined effects of undrained strength non-homogeneity and anisotropy.\",\n          \"\\u00a9 2018 IEEE.Residue number system (RNS) is a number representation system that represents a large integer with several smaller integers. Due to its ability to perform addition and multiplication in parallel, RNS is widely used in signal processing, communication, and cryptography. To extend the ability of RNS, redundant residue number system (RRNS), which has abilities to detect and correct errors, is proposed to be used in fault tolerant applications. Currently, there are two major ways to construct RRNS from RNS. This paper proposes an alternative way to do the construction by using redundant residue representations. Our proposed RRNS can perform certain operations more efficiently, for example, backward conversion and error detection, and can also perform a complex RNS operation, namely, comparing the values between two RRNS representations. However, it would have more costs to perform addition and multiplication on our RRNS. We also compare our work to the two previous works, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Further investigations are required to improve the performance of the proposed RRNS.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Classes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":118}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train_dataset.T.reset_index(drop=True).head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"8vSJzb8fPwn7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118308,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"c073f53c-f500-45f0-df8d-7311135de3c5"},"execution_count":119,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               Title  \\\n","0  Activated carbon derived from bacterial cellul...   \n","1  The algorithm of static hand gesture recogniti...   \n","2  Alternative Redundant Residue Number System Co...   \n","3  Comparative study of wax inhibitor performance...   \n","4  Undrained lower bound solutions for end bearin...   \n","\n","                                            Abstract        Classes  \n","0  © 2019 Elsevier B.V.Activated carbon derived f...

Hand gesture is classified as an intuitive method for human to interact with the computer. It is useful for elderly people who cannot express their feelings by words. This paper proposed the hand gesture recognition technique for the elderly by using contour detection with convex hull feature extraction and rule-based classification. Vision-based hand gesture recognition is considered in classifying six hand gestures as lingual description. From the experimental results, the hand gesture system provides good detection and classification results for all the six static hand gestures.\",\n          \"\\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The undrained bearing capacity of shallow circular piles in non-homogeneous and anisotropic clay is investigated by the lower bound (LB) finite element limit analysis (FELA) under two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric condition using second-order cone programming, and the new solution of the problem is presented. Modified from the isotropic von Mises yield criterion, a cross-anisotropic undrained strength criterion of clays under the axisymmetric state of stress requiring three input shear strengths in triaxial compression, direct simple shear, and triaxial extension is employed in the 2D axisymmetric LB FELA. Parametric studies on the effects of pile embedment ratio, dimensionless strength gradient, anisotropic strength ratio, and pile roughness are investigated extensively, while the predicted failure mechanisms associated with these parameters are discussed and compared. Numerical results of undrained end bearing capacity of shallow circular piles are summarized in the form of design tables that are useful for design practice and represent a new contribution to the field of pile capacity considering the combined effects of undrained strength non-homogeneity and anisotropy.\",\n          \"\\u00a9 2018 IEEE.Residue number system (RNS) is a number representation system that represents a large integer with several smaller integers. Due to its ability to perform addition and multiplication in parallel, RNS is widely used in signal processing, communication, and cryptography. To extend the ability of RNS, redundant residue number system (RRNS), which has abilities to detect and correct errors, is proposed to be used in fault tolerant applications. Currently, there are two major ways to construct RRNS from RNS. This paper proposes an alternative way to do the construction by using redundant residue representations. Our proposed RRNS can perform certain operations more efficiently, for example, backward conversion and error detection, and can also perform a complex RNS operation, namely, comparing the values between two RRNS representations. However, it would have more costs to perform addition and multiplication on our RRNS. We also compare our work to the two previous works, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. Further investigations are required to improve the performance of the proposed RRNS.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Classes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":119}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train = train_dataset.T.reset_index(drop=True) # Training Dataframe"],"metadata":{"id":"QCepMYjgQGRa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118308,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}}},"execution_count":120,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["test_dataset.T.reset_index(drop=True).head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"t8j394x_QbxA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118309,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"ae5e4e84-1fc9-4f89-bc07-1646e8ab421e"},"execution_count":121,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               Title  \\\n","0  Comparative Electrical Energy Yield Performanc...   \n","1  Effects of graphene nanoplatelets on bio-based...   \n","2  Anti-inflammatory action of two novel peptides...   \n","3  Efficient all-and-one support vector machines ...   \n","4  Driver identification using histogram and neur...   \n","\n","                                            Abstract  \n","0  © 2013 IEEE.Long-term energy evaluation of PV ...  \n","1  © The Author(s) 2021.Novel near-infrared (NIR)...  \n","2  © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.Peanut w...  \n","3  © 2018 IEEE.We introduce a new strategy to est...  \n","4  © 2017 IEEE.Sensor technology has continuously...

Incorporation of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) as photothermal fillers into the copolymers provided shape memory properties under near-infrared (NIR) light actuation. The effects of GNP content on photothermal, thermal, dynamic mechanical, morphology, and shape memory properties of the bio-based benzoxazine/epoxy copolymers (V-fa/ECO copolymers) were investigated. The results showed that the addition of GNPs significantly improved the photothermal, thermal, and dynamic mechanical properties of the copolymers. The uniform dispersion of 3 wt% GNPs in the V-fa/ECO copolymers resulted in the highest shape memory performance with shape fixity of 92% and shape recovery of 99% upon NIR light actuation. The recovery time decreased with the increment of GNP content, and the V-fa/ECO copolymers filled with GNPs displayed good execution in the repeated fold-deploy, in which the shape fixity and shape recovery values were close to the original specimen. Therefore, the outstanding properties of V-fa/ECO copolymers filled with GNPs had a potential to be excellent SMPs under NIR actuation.\",\n          \"\\u00a9 2017 IEEE.Sensor technology has continuously improved in term of size and cost. It encourages car companies to embed various types of sensors in their cars. The most common sensors that can be found are location sensor and acceleration sensor. The sensors generate a lot of useful data which could be applied for many future applications such as car tracking or emergency warning. One of the most interesting applications among others is analyzing the driver behavior. There are some previous works using this information to define types of drivers that are related to levels of accident risk. However, the driver behavior not only can separate the type of drivers but also can identify driving characteristic of an individual driver. The driver identification benefits a security application and it can eliminate the global car theft issue. Because the driver behavior cannot be repeated or copied like other anti-theft systems so this is an essential solution to stop increasing the number of stolen cars every year. In this paper, we propose a methodology to identify each driver and classify group of drivers using only accelerating behavior with machine learning technique. In order to identify an individual driver, the acceleration data have been transformed to a histogram in order to represent the accelerating behavior then we utilize a neural network model. We evaluate our methodology with data that have been collected from the acceleration sensors installed on 13 shuttle buses in our campus for more than 10 months. The results show the accuracy of the proposed methodology up to 88.3% for driver identification and up to 92% for driver classification.\",\n          \"\\u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.Peanut worm (Sipunculus nudus Linn.) protein was hydrolyzed by three proteases, and NO scavenging activity of the protein hydrolysates was evaluated. The hydrolysate obtained using Alcalase\\u00ae showed the highest NO scavenging activity. This hydrolysate was fractionated using 10-, 5-, and 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes, and the lowest MW fraction (<3 kDa) exhibited the highest NO scavenging activity. The <3 kDa fraction was further purified by gel filtration and high-performance liquid chromatographies. The peptides in the HPLC fraction with the strongest anti-NO activity were identified by quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry as LSPLLAAH (821.48 Da) and TVNLAYY (843.42 Da). Both peptides and the corresponding pure synthetic peptides inhibited NO production by RAW 264.7 macrophages without cytotoxicity. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that peptides LSPLLAAH and TVNLAYY reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes iNOS, IL-6, TNF-\\u03b1, and COX-2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, suggesting that these peptides are novel anti-inflammatory candidates.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":121}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_test = test_dataset.T.reset_index(drop=True) # Testing Dataframe"],"metadata":{"id":"BtZf2QXiSGKK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118309,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}}},"execution_count":122,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3) Clean & Transform Data"],"metadata":{"id":"um-5DTMsWnql"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import re\n","import nltk\n","# Uncomment to download \"stopwords\"\n","nltk.download(\"stopwords\")\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","\n","def text_preprocessing(s):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    - Lowercase the sentence\n","    - Change \"'t\" to \"not\"\n","    - Remove \"@name\"\n","    - Isolate and remove punctuations except \"?\"\n","    - Remove other special characters\n","    - Remove stop words except \"not\" and \"can\"\n","    - Remove trailing whitespace\n","    \"\"\"\n","    s = s.lower()\n","    # Change 't to 'not'\n","    s = re.sub(r\"\\'t\", \" not\", s)\n","    # Remove @name\n","    s = re.sub(r'(@.*?)[\\s]', ' ', s)\n","    # Isolate and remove punctuations except '?'\n","    s = re.sub(r'([\\'\\\"\\.\\(\\)\\!\\?\\\\\\/\\,])', r' \\1 ', s)\n","    s = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s\\?]', ' ', s)\n","    # Remove some special characters\n","    s = re.sub(r'([\\;\\:\\|•«\\n])', ' ', s)\n","    # Remove stopwords except 'not' and 'can'\n","    s = \" \".join([word for word in s.split()\n","                  if word not in stopwords.words('english')\n","                  or word in ['not', 'can']])\n","    # Remove trailing whitespace\n","    s = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', s).strip()\n","\n","    return s"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"IKqyhOkJyIRC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118309,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"5fb62355-0b18-44c2-9f26-50ba1999b627"},"execution_count":123,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"oaPd7EZoycYi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118309,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"8e1f609e-1c8f-48b3-a04f-8f9077c3af7b"},"execution_count":124,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               Title  \\\n","0  Activated carbon derived from bacterial cellul...   \n","1  The algorithm of static hand gesture recogniti...   \n","2  Alternative Redundant Residue Number System Co...   \n","3  Comparative study of wax inhibitor performance...   \n","4  Undrained lower bound solutions for end bearin...   \n","\n","                                            Abstract        Classes  \n","0  © 2019 Elsevier B.V.Activated carbon derived f...

Most of the tools apply Precedence Diagram Method (PDM) to visualize the activities and their dependencies among various project activities but these tools do not provide semantic representation. Thus, it still requires an implicit knowledge of project managers to analyze and manage scheduling tasks. Ontology could be used to represent the structure of a domain by means of defining concepts and properties that relate them. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose an ontology-based approach for building PDM ontology using OWL and construct SWRL reasoning to infer new knowledge from existing one.\",\n          \"\\u00a9 2018 Author(s).Lattice-mismatched layers of GaAs/InGaAs are grown on GaAs(001) using molecular beam epitaxy and subsequently heated in vacuum while the surface is imaged in situ using low-energy electron microscopy, in order to study (i) the nucleation of group-III droplets formed as a result of noncongruent sublimation and (ii) the dynamics of these self-propelled droplets as they navigate the surface. It is found that the interfacial misfit dislocation network not only influences the nucleation sites of droplets, but also exerts unusual steering power over their subsequent motion. Atypical droplet flow patterns including 90\\u00b0 and 180\\u00b0 turns are found. The directions of these dislocations-guided droplets are qualitatively explained in terms of in-plane and out-of-plane stress fields associated with the buried dislocations and the driving forces due to chemical potential and stress gradients typical of Marangoni flow. The findings would benefit processes and devices that employ droplets as catalysts or active structures such as droplet epitaxy of quantum nanostructures, vapor-liquid-solid growth of nanowires, or the fabrication of self-integrated circuits.\",\n          \"\\u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Recently, aluminum extrusion with a built-in V-rail linear bearing draws increasing attention, especially among the hobbyist and makers, and is applied into many of their projects. The aluminum extrusion is an open source, light weight, and coming with extensive accessory. This significantly reduces cost and gives flexibility to their projects. Its performance is reasonable and adequate for operations among hobbyist and university's projects. However, the precise accuracy of this kind of robot is usually unavailable. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to investigate and analyse performance of the V-Slot extrusion with built-in linear rails robot in terms of accuracy and repeatability. The tools, in this investigation, can be obtained within the ecosystem and the process can be done by the user. This performance result will help general users to define the scope of the operation that can be achieved with reasonable result when using this robot. The methodology, in this experiment, is Trajectory analysis approach that commands the robot to move in both linear and circular, with various travel distances, in a single run, and determine the defects. Effects of travel speed are also investigated. From experimental result, the accuracy of the experimental robot is 0.45 mm in the entire range of motion. This methodology can be applied to other machines with their accuracy not better than 0.1 millimetre due to the precision of tools that are used.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Classes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":124}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NjXr3jBFzhSK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118309,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"64f9759e-09cf-46bd-8f5b-57d39e83b2f5"},"execution_count":125,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(454, 3)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":125}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train.iloc[0][0] # Title"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"LqFkkpqvzIN2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118309,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"6fb0270b-5990-41c7-a128-8ce12f1e5b33"},"execution_count":126,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Activated carbon derived from bacterial cellulose and its use as catalyst support for ethanol conversion to ethylene'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":126}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train.iloc[0][1] # Abstract"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":145},"id":"bzX7PsqjzbS4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118309,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"3ff0a58b-a586-438d-a394-0f1f3bd575e1"},"execution_count":127,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Activated carbon derived from bacterial cellulose (BC-AC) was modified with various amounts of H3PO4(x wt% P/BC-AC) and used as a catalyst for the selective dehydration of ethanol to ethylene. The BC-AC obtained at a carbonization temperature of 500 °C had a mesoporous structure with surface area and total pore volume of ~1730 m2/g and 1.0 cm3/g, respectively. An increase in the H3PO4 loading from 5% to 40% increased the number of weak acid sites on the catalyst surface, which consequently enhanced ethanol conversion. At the reaction temperature of 400 °C, the modified BC-AC with 30-40 wt% H3PO4 loading (P/BC-AC) gave an ethanol conversion at 100% and an ethylene selectivity of 100%. A high selectivity for diethyl ether (DEE) at ~ 67% at ethanol conversion of ~ 50% was obtained at 200 °C. Stability tests with a time-on-stream of 12 h, at reaction temperatures of 200 and 400 °C, showed that the P/BC-AC catalyst had high thermal stability and stable catalytic activity. Therefore, P/BC-AC was found to be very effective as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly catalyst for ethylene production via ethanol dehydration.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":127}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train.iloc[0][2] # Classes"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jta7j-AuzlFn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769118309,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"3e63fb33-ff87-47c6-da72-970206a1d571"},"execution_count":128,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['CHE', 'MATENG']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":128}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Clean and Transform Training Data"],"metadata":{"id":"-hHUwsheYcvA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = []\n","for i in range(0, df_train.shape[0]):\n","  text_and_class = []\n","  title = df_train.iloc[i][0]\n","  abstract = df_train.iloc[i][1]\n","  classes = df_train.iloc[i][2]\n","\n","  title_abstract = title + \" \" + abstract # concat title and abstract\n","\n","  text_and_class.append(text_preprocessing(title_abstract))\n","  text_and_class.append(classes)\n","\n","  data.append(text_and_class)"],"metadata":{"id":"UPq2js7fzoV2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769124757,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":6459,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}}},"execution_count":129,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["new_df_train = pd.DataFrame(data = data, columns = [\"Text\", \"Classes\"])"],"metadata":{"id":"cUh0qmi22Xbi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769124757,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}}},"execution_count":130,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["new_df_train.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"oWCnfM4V65Ba","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710769124757,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Napat Nillapruek","userId":"07001684480626948274"}},"outputId":"50b6f4a7-37ba-411e-f710-f9c403de06fb"},"execution_count":131,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                Text        Classes\n","0  activated carbon derived bacterial cellulose u...
